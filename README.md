### ðŸ‘‹   Nice to meet you.

I'm a photographer turned into a front-end developer, so I definitely have the eye for details everybody is looking for. In less than three months I've been able to create my first SPAs with React, Javascript Vanilla and SASS and HTML5 and I honestly think that's quite impressive, bear with me. Still, I know I need to step up my game a little bit more, so I'm giving my first steps with React Native and Angular. Never thought a hard merge would be *the **most*** unsettling thing I would ever feel.


You can check some of my repositories [here](https://github.com/miriamschaefer?tab=repositories) and give me some feedback, most of them are work in progress, so you know, be nice and cut me some slack ðŸ‘€

I'm based in Madrid (Spain), so if you need anything and while I work on my [porfolio](https://miriamschaefer.github.io/porfolio/), you can ðŸ’Œ [email](mailto:msuarezmelian@gmail.com) me, visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msuarezmelian/) (hire me!) or check my [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/miriamschaefer). Oh, also I [tweet and retweet](https://www.twitter.com/in/miriam_schaefer/) basically nonsense.
