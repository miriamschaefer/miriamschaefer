### ðŸ‘‹   Nice to meet you.

I'm a photographer turned into a front-end developer based in Madrid (Spain), so if you need anything and while I work on my [porfolio](https://miriamschaefer.github.io/porfolio/), you can ðŸ’Œ [email](mailto:msuarezmelian@gmail.com) me, visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msuarezmelian/) (hire me!) or check my [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/miriamschaefer).

Oh, also I [tweet and retweet](https://www.twitter.com/in/miriam_schaefer/) basically nonsense.

Never thought a hard merge would be *the **most*** unsettling thing I would ever feel.
