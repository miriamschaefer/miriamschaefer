### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's Miriam, nice to meet you.

I'm a photographer turned into a front-end developer. In less than three months I've been able to create my first SPAs with React, Javascript Vanilla and SASS and HTML and I honestly think that's quite impressive. 

Never thought a hard merge would be the most unsettling thing I would feel.
