### ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you.

I'm a photographer turned into a front-end developer, so I definitely have the eye for details everybody loves. In less than three months I've been able to create my first SPAs with React, Javascript Vanilla and SASS and HTML and I honestly think that's quite impressive. Never thought a hard merge would be the most unsettling thing I would feel.

You can check some of my repositories [here] (https://github.com/miriamschaefer?tab=repositories) and give me some feedback, most of them are work in progress, so you know, be nice and cut me some slack ðŸ‘€.
