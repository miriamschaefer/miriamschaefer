### ðŸ‘‹  Nice to meet you.

I'm a photographer turned into a front-end developer, so I definitely have the eye for details everybody loves. In less than three months I've been able to create my first SPAs with React, Javascript Vanilla and SASS and HTML5 and I honestly think that's quite impressive, bear with me. Never thought a hard merge would be the most unsettling thing I would ever feel.

You can check some of my repositories [here] (https://github.com/miriamschaefer?tab=repositories) and give me some feedback, most of them are work in progress, so you know, be nice and cut me some slack ðŸ‘€.

If you want, you can ðŸ’Œ [email] (mailto:msuarezmelian@gmail.com) me, visit my [Linkedin] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/msuarezmelian/) (hire me!) or check my [Instagram] (http://www.instagram.com/miriamschaefer). Oh, also I [tweet and retweet] (https://www.twitter.com/in/miriam_schaefer/) basically nonsense.
